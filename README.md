# HTML Viewer

A fast, mobile-first, **single-file** HTML viewer. Drag & drop an HTML file
anywhere on the page and it **renders** instantly; one tap flips to a
syntax-highlighted **code view**. Web source files — CSS, SCSS, Less, JS, TS,
and template/server files (Vue, Svelte, Astro, PHP, ERB, Twig, …) — open
straight into the highlighted source. It's a **viewer, not an editor** — no
toolbars, no accounts, no uploads. Everything runs locally in your browser.

> Part of a family of viewers. Markdown, data formats (JSON/YAML/XML/CSV),
> EPUB, and PDF each have their own dedicated viewer, so those file types are
> intentionally **not** accepted here.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Renders HTML** — drop an `.html`/`.htm`/`.xhtml` file and it renders in a
  **sandboxed iframe**, faithfully — its own inline CSS, images, and web fonts
  included.
- `</>` **Code view** — a toggle button flips between the rendered page and the
  **syntax-highlighted source**, with line numbers. Non-HTML source files open
  straight into this view.
- 📄 **Web source files** — `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.js`, `.jsx`,
  `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.php`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro`, and
  [many more](#supported-file-types) open directly into the highlighted source.
- ✨ **Format / beautify** — got a minified or obfuscated file? A `{ }` toggle
  pretty-prints HTML, CSS/SCSS/LESS, and JS/TS/JSX/JSON on demand (re-indented,
  one statement per line), and flips back to the raw original. It fixes *layout*
  — perfect for un-minifying — but it can't rename mangled identifiers in truly
  obfuscated code, so those names stay as they are.
- ✅ **File-type checking** — only HTML-family files are accepted; other types
  (Markdown, data formats, EPUB, PDF) are politely declined so you land in the
  right viewer.
- 🏷️ **Filename in the header** — when you open or drop a file, its name shows
  in the top-left, next to its file-type icon.
- 📋 **Copy** — copies the source to your clipboard (the formatted version when
  **Format** is on).
- 🗑️ **Clear** — empties the view.
- 🎨 **Pick any background color** — a color swatch in the header lets you choose
  any background. Text, borders, and syntax colors automatically adapt for
  contrast. Your choice is **remembered** — saved to a cookie, with a
  `localStorage` fallback so even a downloaded `file://` copy remembers it.
  Starts on white.
- 🫥 **Distraction-free** — a **rendered page opens with the header hidden** for
  an unobstructed first paint. The header hides when you scroll **down** and
  comes back when you scroll **up**, when you pause for 5 seconds, or when you
  move to the top edge; the footer has a **×** to tuck it away entirely. The
  header shows the file-type icon next to the filename (and just the icon + app
  name on the empty screen).
- 📥 **Full-screen drop zone** — drag a file and the whole window becomes the
  target. You can also **paste** source text directly.
- 📱 **Mobile-first** & responsive, with safe-area support for notched phones.
- 🔒 **Safe by default** — HTML renders inside a `sandbox`ed iframe with **no
  `allow-scripts`**, so a viewed page displays with its own styles but **can
  never run JavaScript**. Your files never leave your device.
- 🪶 **One file, no build** — `index.html` is self-contained (~255 KB, libraries
  bundled inline) and the viewer works offline, even straight from `file://`.
- 📊 **Privacy-friendly analytics** — the hosted site uses a self-hosted,
  cookieless [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance (see [Privacy](#privacy)).

## Quick start

**Just open it.** Download [`index.html`](index.html), double-click it, and
you're done — it runs locally with no server, no build, and no internet
connection.

Prefer a local server?

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080   # then open http://localhost:8080
```

Any static web server works too — there is nothing to build.

## Supported file types

Dropped or opened files are validated: only HTML-family and web-source types
are accepted; anything else shows a brief “not a supported file type” notice.

**Rendered as a page** (with a toggle to source): `.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`,
`.xht`, `.shtml`, `.shtm`, `.stm`, `.hta`. A file with no extension renders too
when its content starts with `<!doctype html>` or `<html>`.

**Opened as highlighted source:**

- **Styles** — `.css` · `.scss` · `.sass` · `.less` · `.styl` · `.pcss` · `.postcss`
- **Scripts** — `.js` · `.mjs` · `.cjs` · `.jsx` · `.ts` · `.mts` · `.cts` · `.tsx` · `.coffee`
- **Templates / components** — `.vue` · `.svelte` · `.astro` · `.php` · `.phtml` ·
  `.erb` · `.ejs` · `.hbs` · `.handlebars` · `.mustache` · `.njk` · `.liquid` ·
  `.twig` · `.jinja` · `.j2` · `.pug` · `.jade` · `.haml` · `.slim` · `.asp` ·
  `.aspx` · `.ascx` · `.cshtml` · `.vbhtml` · `.jsp` · `.jspx` · `.cfm` · `.rhtml`
- **Config / misc** — `.env` · `.ini` · `.conf` · `.htaccess` · `.htpasswd` ·
  `.webmanifest` · `.map` (sourcemaps) · `robots.txt` · `.mhtml` · `.mht`

The language is picked from the extension, falling back to automatic detection.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploy from this repo)

Connect the repository in the Cloudflare dashboard
(**Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git**) and use:

| Setting                  | Value            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Production branch        | `main`           |
| Framework preset         | `None`           |
| Build command            | *(leave blank)*  |
| Build output directory   | `/`              |

It's a static site — Cloudflare just serves `index.html`. The included
[`_headers`](_headers) file applies security headers (CSP, `nosniff`,
`frame-ancestors`, etc.) automatically. Every push to `main` then
auto-deploys.

Add your custom domain `html-viewer.us` under the project's **Custom domains**
tab — Cloudflare creates the DNS record and provisions SSL for you.

## How it works

Everything is in [`index.html`](index.html):

- Your HTML/CSS/UI and the app logic — no build step, no tooling.
- HTML is written to a **`sandbox`ed `<iframe>`** via `srcdoc`. The sandbox has
  no `allow-scripts`, so the rendered page displays with its own styles but
  **cannot execute any JavaScript** — that's the security boundary. (It uses
  `allow-same-origin` only so the viewer can follow the frame's scroll to drive
  the auto-hiding header; with no `allow-scripts`, no script ever runs.)
- [**highlight.js**](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) `v11.9.0`
  (BSD-3-Clause) powers the code view, and [**js-beautify**](https://github.com/beautifier/js-beautify)
  `v1.15.1` (MIT) powers the **Format** toggle. Both are embedded inline
  (minified, with their license banners retained), so highlighting and
  beautifying work with **no network dependencies** and fully offline. The only
  external request is the analytics script on the hosted site (see
  [Privacy](#privacy)).

## Privacy

Your files stay on your device — they're read in the browser and never uploaded
anywhere, and your content is never sent to any server.

The hosted site at **html-viewer.us** uses a self-hosted
[Plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance for **privacy-friendly, cookieless**
page analytics: aggregate visit counts only — no personal data, no cross-site
tracking, no advertising. Plausible automatically ignores `localhost` and
`file://`, so a downloaded local copy reports nothing.

The only thing stored on your device is your chosen background color (a cookie,
with a `localStorage` fallback).
